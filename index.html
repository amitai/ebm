<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to expect from the Shabbat service</h2>
<p>If you're generally familiar with Shabbat services, but not our particular service, this section is for you. <mark>If you're not familiar with Shabbat services, scroll to the <a href="#survival-guide">survival guide</a>.</mark> </p>
<p>The will take place with a full-liturgy, participant-led egalitarian minyan.  Ezra's bar mitzvah is just one part of the service. Here are some things that make this service a little different from other Shabbat morning services you may have attended:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We are participant-led. We do not have a cantor or rabbi.</li>
    <li>We are egalitarian, meaning that Jewish adults of any gender can hold any roles for which they are qualified including aliyot, leyning, leading services. We do not have assigned sections for men and women.</li>
    <li>We do not announce page numbers, and choreography instructions are not provided. While prayer books are provided, all are encouraged to bring the siddur of their choice.  Though this diversity of siddurim means that page numbers are not announced, Segulah provides a grid that lists page numbers in several popular siddurim.  There are no explicit directions such as "Please rise"; all are invited to sit or stand according to their own customs or preferences.</li>
    <li>With the exception of announcements, the service itself is conducted in Hebrew. </li>
    <li>Please bring your own tallit if you wish to wear one.  </li>
</ul>

<p>(adapted from the original by the Muller family)</p>
<p>If you're not very familiar with Jewish prayer services, this section is for you! If you've never been at a traditional Jewish service before, a lot of it may seem strange and intimidating!</p>

<h3>Key things to know</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Jewish services are LONG: For many people, the most startling thing about Jewish services is their length (and that they are in Hebrew).  A standard Saturday morning service lasts about 2.5 - 3 hours, but don't panic. Not everyone comes for the whole thing (it's not uncommon for people to get there an hour in).  This is NOT seen as disrespectful; it's totally normal.  It's perfectly OK to step out of services for a while. </li>
<li>Seating: There are no reserved seats. Sit anywhere that you see an open seat.  Some congregants lay their books or prayer shawl bags on empty seats, but they'll move them into their own seat as soon as they see a person in need of a place to sit (you are not putting them out or inconveniencing them). </li>

<li>Don't use electronic devices at services (including phones and cameras). Please silence your cell phone and refrain from using any electronic devices during services and the luncheon that follows.  If you need to use your device, please set outside of the room.</li>

<li>Dress Code: Many people express the special nature of the Sabbath and festivals by dressing in festive and/or "nicer" clothing. This might be described as "business," "business casual," or "dressy." However, in this congregation you'll see a fair range of dress levels.  You will see some people in jeans and a t-shirt, and some people in a suit and tie.  Everyone is welcome to attend services no matter how they happen to be dressed. </li>

<li>Head coverings: Jewish men and sometimes women traditionally cover their heads during services, but there is no expectation that you do so.</li> 

<li>Standing and Sitting: You may notice that people alternate between standing and sitting at different points in the service. You should not feel uncomfortable about "doing it right" but should generally follow the cues of the congregation to see when it is appropriate to stand or sit. No one will be offended if you miss a cue and you should not be self-conscious if you lag. Also, it's totally fine to stay seated if for whatever reason standing is not comfortable for you. </li>

<li>Where's the Rabbi? In Judaism, you don't need a rabbi to have services.  In fact, our congregation doesn't have one at all.  All the components of the services are led by congregants.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Structure of the Service</h3>
<p>Our Shabbat morning services contain a few distinct parts (detailed below). We begin with a series of prayers and then move to a portion of the service in which we remove the Torah scroll from the aron (ark) to read the weekly portion. After the Torah reading there is an additional reading called the haftarah which is followed by returning the Torah to the ark. Following this, we re-commence with prayers and then conclude the service. </p>

<p>You will see that congregants switch between two books during services. For the prayer portions at the beginning and end, we use a book called a siddur (prayer book) which contains all the prayers recited in our congregation in original Hebrew and in English translation. This is the smaller of the two books.</p>

<p>During the Torah reading portion of the service, we use the larger book, the chumash (Pentateuch), which contains the full text of the Torah (Five Books of Moses).</p>
